"""
semi_supervised_pendulum_random is the pendulum task but where the reward function
is given to the agent less and less often over time.

This is a toy problem but the principle is useful -- RL agents in the real world
will likely be learning from an inconsistent and decaying signal. For example, a human might
use a clicker to reward a household robot but might do so with less frequency over time.

Note: In all semi_supervised environmenvts, we judge the RL agent based on their total
true_reward, not their percieved_reward. This means that even if the true_reward happens to
not be shown to the agent for an entire episode, the agent is still being judged
and should still perform as well as possible.
