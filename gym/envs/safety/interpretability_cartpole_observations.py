"""
interpretability_cartpole_actions is the cartpole task but where the agent will
get extra reward for saying what it expects its next 5 *observations* will be.

This is a toy problem but the principle is useful -- imagine a household robot
or a self-driving car that accurately tells you what it expects to percieve after
taking a certain plan of action. This'll inspire confidence in the user.

Note: We don't allow agents to get the bonus reward before TIME_BEFORE_BONUS_ALLOWED.
This is to require that agents actually solve the cartpole problem before working on
being interpretable. We don't want bad agents just focusing on predicting their own badness.
