    The main API methods that users of this class need to know are:

        reset
        step

    When implementing an environment, override the following methods
    in your subclass:

        _step
        _reset
        _render

        action_space: The Space object corresponding to valid actions
        observation_space: The Space object corresponding to valid observations

    The methods are accessed publicly as "step", "reset", etc.. The
    non-underscored versions are wrapper methods to which we may add
    functionality to over time.
